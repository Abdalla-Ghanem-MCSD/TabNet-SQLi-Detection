## 🧠 Project Overview

This project applies **TabNet**, a deep learning model optimized for tabular data, to detect SQL injection (SQLi) attacks in web applications using a supervised machine learning approach.

The goal is to provide:
- Better accuracy than traditional models.
- Faster detection.
- Explainability and robustness against adversarial SQLi.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used is composed of labeled SQL queries (`benign` or `injection`).
- Preprocessed using **TF-IDF** vectorization with `1000` features.
- Input: Raw SQL query (text).
- Output: Label (0 = Normal, 1 = SQL Injection).

---

## ⚙️ Model Details

- Model: `TabNetClassifier` (from pytorch-tabnet).
- Preprocessing: TF-IDF Vectorizer (`sklearn`).
- Loss Function: Cross-entropy.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC.
- Regularization: Early stopping, learning rate scheduler.
